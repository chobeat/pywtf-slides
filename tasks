diagram in the beginning,
 code samples, 
make your own project, 
x pyscaffold    goes at the end, 
pipenv before poetry, 
tagline for each tool,
 ideal world compare with other languages,
 explain better    the tasks they are trying to solve,
x change the dollar in the description, 
xI should     introduce the scale,
? talk about operative systems,
x    replace cusses with WTF,
x replace terrible names with confusing,
 add conclusion,
    add slide to explain the problems,
x add contacts and hiring info at the end
replace simone picture
